# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** January 2026

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how the **Download Takeout Files** CLI tool handles information.

This is an open-source command-line tool that runs locally on your machine. It is not designed to collect or transmit personal data.

## 2. No Data Collection

**Download Takeout Files does not collect, store, transmit, or sell any personal information.**

- No analytics
- No telemetry
- No tracking
- No logging of user activity

The tool only does what you explicitly tell it to do.

## 3. Local Execution Only

All operations run locally on your computer.

Any files downloaded, tokens used, or data accessed remain on your machine and under your control. Nothing is sent to the project author or any external service beyond what is required to interact with Google APIs that you authorize.

## 4. Authentication and Third-Party Services

If you authenticate with Google (for example, to access Google Drive), that authentication is handled directly with Google.

This tool does **not** intercept, store, or transmit your credentials outside of your local environment.

Google’s handling of your data is governed by Google’s own privacy policy.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

This privacy policy may be updated if the tool’s behavior changes. The “Last updated” date will reflect the most recent changes.
